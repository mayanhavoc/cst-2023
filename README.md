## Color scheme

I really suck at design, so I'm making some notes on how I'm deciding to style this site.

The color **black** is associated with: power, elegance, formality, death, evil and mystery.
Black background makes lettering stand out. Beware of small lettering with too high contrast (white lettering), will lead to less legibility because of overwhelming background (keep fonts with good size).

Black background: white, yellow lettering.

**White** is associated with light, goodness, innocence, purity and virginity. Beware of white absorbing its environment. Black lettering tends to be squeezed into the background making it harder to read. Lower contrast lettering gives better results: blue, orange and red.

**Red** is associated with energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination, passions, desire, love. Works great with black, white and yellow lettering.

I'm starting with a deep red #FD0202 for the background and a pure black #000000 for the heading.
